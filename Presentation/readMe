Contains Report of the Project made and the process involed developing the app. 
From understanding the requirements of the users, to focusing on the target audience, 
coming up with different ideas how to implement the app and then finally developing the prototype, it has been an interactive process.
The class taught me that development is not the final stage of a project. It is the stage after, the moment of truth, if you will,
when the app is tested by the target audience. This is when we gain valuable feedback and suggestions to improve upon the app.
